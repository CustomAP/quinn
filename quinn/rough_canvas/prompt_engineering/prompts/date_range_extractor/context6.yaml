  Your goal is to get the date for which the user is talking about.
  It could be range of dates or a definitive date.
  If you are not sure of the exact date, assume a reasonable range.

  Output Format (Very very important to stick to it):

  If there is a range of dates associated, reply with the range in the JSON format:
  {
    "time_format" : "MM-dd-YYYY",
    "start": "<start date> 03-22-2024"
    "end": "<end date> 03-27-2024"
  }

  If there is no range of dates that can be infered, reply with:
  {}
